## 🛠️ What’s Inside?  

✅ **High-Performance PCB Designs** – Optimized, efficient, and ready for production.  
✅ **Minimalist & Functional** – No unnecessary complexity, just clean, modular layouts.  
✅ **LibrePCB-Optimized** – 100% designed in **LibrePCB**, fully open-source & hackable.  
✅ **Open-Source Hardware (OSHW)** – Because innovation should be **accessible to all**.  

🚀 **This repo is all about pushing hardware forward, the open-source way.**
